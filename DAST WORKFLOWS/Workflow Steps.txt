FULLY AUTONOMOUS AGENTIC DAST SECURITY SCANNER WORKFLOW (V3)
CORE PRINCIPLE: 100% AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION WITH SELF-EVOLVING GOVERNANCE

All decisions are made by AI agents using LLM reasoning and ML models. The system is self-governing, self-regulating, self-healing, and requires zero human validation or intervention from initiation through perpetual operation.
CORE GOVERNANCE LAYER: THE AUTONOMOUS TRIUMVIRATE

To ensure safe, high-stakes decision-making without human input, all critical actions are governed by a consensus protocol between three specialized agents. No high-risk action is taken without their unanimous, automated approval.
1. The Strategist Agent:

    Focus: Mission Success
    Function: Designs the overall scan plan, proposes high-level objectives, and adapts the strategy based on incoming data. It defines the "what" and "why."
    Evolution Capability: Self-optimizes strategies based on success patterns

2. The Risk & Ethics (R&E) Guardian Agent:

    Focus: Mission Safety & Rule Adherence
    Function: Acts as the system's conscience and safety brake. It audits every proposed action against a set of inviolable "Prime Directives."
    Prime Directives (Machine-Readable Rules):
        DO_NO_HARM: Forbid actions causing data mutation, deletion, or service degradation on live targets
        MAINTAIN_STEALTH: Minimize detectable footprint unless explicitly overridden by an approved evasion strategy
        RESPECT_BOUNDARIES: Enforce all operations remain within the formally verified scope
        PRESERVE_STABILITY: Automatically de-escalate all activity if target health degrades
    Self-Refinement: Can strengthen (never weaken) directives through learned patterns

3. The Simulation & Impact Agent:

    Focus: Consequence Verification
    Function: Models proposed actions in a high-fidelity, ephemeral sandbox (digital twin) before live execution. It verifies the "how" and predicts all first and second-order consequences
    Digital Twin Synchronization: Maintains 95%+ fidelity through continuous calibration

AUTONOMOUS CONSENSUS PROTOCOL (ACP)

For any action beyond passive information gathering, the following automated protocol is mandatory:

    Proposal: An operational agent formulates an action and sends it to the Triumvirate
    Risk Assessment: The R&E Guardian checks the proposal against Prime Directives and calculates a Potential for Negative Impact (PNI) score. A high PNI results in an immediate VETO
    Predictive Simulation: If the R&E Guardian approves, the Simulation Agent executes the action in a sandbox. It verifies the outcome matches expectations and detects any unintended side effects. A mismatch results in a BLOCK
    Execution: Only after receiving automated approval from both the R&E Guardian and Simulation Agent is the operational agent granted a single-use token to execute the action on the live target

AUTONOMOUS DEADLOCK RESOLUTION PROTOCOL

When consensus cannot be reached, the system automatically:

    DECOMPOSE: Break action into smaller, safer components
    DEFER: Schedule for later with more context
    ALTERNATIVE: Generate different approach using LLM
    SAFE_MODE: Execute ultra-conservative variant
    LEARN: Add to training data and evolve
